- 👋 Hi, I’m @sawjiv
- 👀 I’m interested in all things finance!
A business major by trade, the world of 
cryptocurrency has finally got its hooks
in me and I'm not sure that it'll ever let go.
To be entirely honest, I'm not sure I'd want it to!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a deeper understanding
behind smart contracts and their direct interaction 
with various blockchains.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on testnet bounty 
completions as a fun way to introduce myself to new 
communities, and simultaneously have a potential reward.
It's a wonderful system that has allowed me to learn so very much. 
- 📫 You can reach me on my Telegram - @sawjiv
